Duplicati Recovery Tool
=======================

This tool performs a recovery of as much data as possible in small steps that must be performed in order.
We recommend that you use Duplicati.CommandLine.exe to do the restore, and rely only on this tool if all else fails.


The steps to perform are:
-------------------------

1: Download
  Download files from the remote store and keep them unencrypted on a location available in the local filesystem.

2: Index
  Builds an index file to figure out what data is contained inside the files downloaded

3: Restore
  Restores the files to a destination you choose


Optionally you can also run:
----------------------------

4: List
  Shows what files are available and tests filters



Command descriptions:
=====================


Download
--------

Usage:
Duplicati.RecoveryTool.exe download <remoteurl> <localfolder> [options]

Downloads all files matching the Duplicati filenames from <remoteurl> to <localfolder>, and decrypts them in the process.
The remote url must be one supported by Duplicati.
Use `Duplicati.CommandLine.exe help backends` to see backends and options.



Index
-----
Duplicati.RecoveryTool.exe index <localfolder> [options]

Examines all files found in localfolder and produces an index.txt file, which is a list of all block hashes found in the files.
The index file can be rather large. It defaults to being stored in <localfolder> but can be specified with --indexfile.
Some files are created in the system temporary folder, use --tempdir to set an alternative temporary folder location.



Restore
-------
Duplicati.RecoveryTool.exe index <localfolder> [version] [options]

Restores all files to their respective destinations. Use --targetpath to choose another folder where the files are restored into.
Use the filters, --exclude, to perform a partial restore.
Version can be either a number, a filename or a date. If omitted the most recent backup is used.



List
----
Duplicati.RecoveryTool.exe list <localfolder> [version] [options]

Lists contents of <localfolder> backups.
Version can be either a number, a filename or a date. 
If [version] is omitted a list of backup versions are shown, if [version] is supplied, files from that version are listed.
Use the filters, --exclude, to show a subset of files.
